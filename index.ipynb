While we have naturally already used metrics with neural networks, we'll now see how to use validaiton methods like K-Folds. Additionally, we'll be introduced to `TensorBoard`, which is essentially a dashboard for `TesnorFlow`. It will help us evaluate our model.\n",

        "Another modeling problem occurs when one gets trapped into a local minimum when searching for an optimal solution using an iterative approach such as gradient descent. One technique for counteracting this scenario is normalizing features. Normalization in deep learning models can drastically decrease computation time, mitigate common issues such as vanishing or exploding gradients, and increase model performance.\n",

        "\n",
        "You've seen regularization before in many other models including linear regression. For example, recall the L1 and L2 penalties which modify ordinary linear regression. These updated loss functions can help tune models so they do not overfit to the training data. For neural networks, you'll use a surprisingly similar process in order to achieve well trained models that are neither overfit nor underfit.\n",
